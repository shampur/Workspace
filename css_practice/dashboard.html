            a) Combine all the script into one single file and same with the styles sheet and minify both.<br>
            b) Use CSS Sprites.<br>
            c) Use a CDN for delivering your static content, this helps loading the images, sprites, css,
            scripts from a server that is geographically nearest to you. And since those would be served from a
            different hostname they can be downloaded in parallel.

            <div class="heading">What does a doctype do in html? </div>
            Doctype defines the version and the standard in which the html document is written,
            This is an instruction to the browser. Doctype stands for Document type definition.

            <div class="heading">Script tag.</div>
            Script tag stops the rendering, downloads the script and executes it.
            Script async does not stop the rendering,
            instead it downloads the script asynchronously and runs it once the download is complete
            Script defer runs the script only after the rendering process is complete.
